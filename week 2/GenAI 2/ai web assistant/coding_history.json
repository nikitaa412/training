    "content": "Certainly! Below is a Python function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms using an iterative approach, including comments explaining each step.\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci_sequence(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.\n\n    Parameters:\n    n (int): The number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence to generate.\n\n    Returns:\n    list: A list containing the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n\n    # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers\n    fibonacci_sequence = [0, 1]\n    \n    # If n is less than or equal to 2, return the first n terms\n    if n <= 2:\n        return fibonacci_sequence[:n]\n\n    # Generate the rest of the Fibonacci sequence iteratively\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        next_term = fibonacci_sequence[i - 1] + fibonacci_sequence[i - 2]\n        fibonacci_sequence.append(next_term)\n\n    return fibonacci_sequence\n\n# Example usage\nn_terms = 5\nfibonacci_list = fibonacci_sequence(n_terms)\nprint(f\"Fibonacci sequence up to {n_terms} terms: {fibonacci_list}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `fibonacci_sequence` takes an integer `n` as input, which specifies the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n2. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns an empty list since there are no terms to generate.\n   - If `n` is 1 or 2, it directly returns a list containing the first two Fibonacci numbers, `[0, 1]`.\n\n3. **Generating the Sequence**:\n   - The sequence starts with the first two Fibonacci numbers, `[0, 1]`.\n   - For each subsequent term, it calculates the next number as the sum of the two preceding ones.\n   - This iterative approach continues until `n` terms have been generated.\n\n4. **Example Usage**: The function is called with `n = 5`, and the sequence up to that number is printed.\n\nThis code efficiently generates the Fibonacci sequence using a loop, which avoids stack overflow issues for large values of `n`."
