i need to build an 'Insurance claim validator' using agentic-AI with three agents:
1. document extractor
2. policy checker
3. fraud detector

all this using crew-ai or langchain framework. for the fraud detector agent i need to build a machine learning model
with lof (local outlier factor) and predict if its a legitimate or fraud claim.

i need to integrate this with an LLM (llama model preferred), and it should return if its a legitimate or fraud claim,
i have a dataset of health insurance fraud to train the ml model as well

when i first upload the document, the document extractor should check if its a health insurance document or no.
if it is a health insurance document then pass it on to the policy checker and further to the fraud detector.

if its a legitimate claim, display 'claim approved' and why it is a legitimate claim
of its a fraud claim, display 'claim rejected' and why it is a fraud claim
